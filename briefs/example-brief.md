# Project Brief: Olivia Network Brand Positioning

## Client
Olivia Network — an AI-powered professional services platform

## Challenge
Olivia Network needs a compelling brand positioning that differentiates it in the crowded AI/tech space. The platform connects professionals with AI agents that handle complex business tasks — from research to content creation to strategic analysis.

## Target Audience
- Business professionals aged 30-55
- Decision-makers at mid-to-large companies
- Early adopters of AI tools who want more than chatbots
- People who value quality, depth, and professional-grade output

## Key Requirements
1. A brand concept that communicates intelligence without being cold
2. A positioning that separates Olivia from generic "AI assistant" products
3. Visual direction that feels premium and trustworthy
4. A headline and tagline that work across web, social, and presentations
5. A narrative that explains WHY this matters, not just WHAT it does

## Constraints
- Must work globally (no culturally specific references)
- Must feel human and warm despite being AI-powered
- Must not use cliche AI imagery (robots, blue circuits, glowing brains)
- Budget: premium but not luxury — accessible sophistication

## What Success Looks Like
A brand positioning so clear and compelling that anyone who sees it immediately understands what Olivia Network is, why it exists, and why they should care.

## Deliverables Expected
- Brand concept with name rationale
- Primary headline + subhead
- 3-5 lines of body copy
- Visual direction (colors, mood, imagery style)
- Image generation prompt for hero visual
- Video concept for 30-second explainer
