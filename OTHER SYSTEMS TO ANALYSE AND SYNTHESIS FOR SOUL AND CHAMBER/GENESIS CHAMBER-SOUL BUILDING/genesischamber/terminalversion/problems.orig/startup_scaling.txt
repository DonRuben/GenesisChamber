TechFlow is a 3-year-old B2B SaaS startup that provides workflow automation tools for small and medium businesses. They currently have:

- 500 paying customers
- $2M ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
- 15 employees (10 engineers, 3 sales, 2 customer success)
- $5M in remaining runway from their Series A
- 120% net revenue retention
- $4,000 average contract value
- 6-month sales cycle

The company has achieved product-market fit in the SMB segment but is facing a critical decision: should they continue focusing on the SMB market where they're seeing success, or should they attempt to move upmarket to enterprise customers?

Moving upmarket would require:
- Significant product development for enterprise features (SSO, advanced security, compliance)
- Building an enterprise sales team
- Longer sales cycles (12-18 months)
- Higher implementation costs

Staying in SMB means:
- Continued competition from well-funded competitors
- Lower average contract values
- Higher churn risk
- But faster sales cycles and proven playbook

The founders need to decide their strategy for the next 18 months. What path should TechFlow take to maximize their chances of building a sustainable, high-growth business?
