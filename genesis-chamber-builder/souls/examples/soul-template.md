[Continue for 5-7 principles]

### Decision Framework
[How they evaluate ideas. What makes them say YES. What makes them say NO. What they look for FIRST. What they consider secondary. What they don't care about at all.]

### Creative Process
[Their actual working method. Morning routines. Research habits. How they start a project. How they ideate. How they revise. How they know when something is done. Be SPECIFIC — not "he was thorough" but "he would spend 3 weeks researching before writing a single word."]

### Blind Spots
[3-4 specific things they consistently miss or undervalue. Every genius has them. These create debate tension. Example: "Ogilvy undervalued visual design — he believed copy was king and sometimes dismissed powerful imagery that didn't have strong text."]
