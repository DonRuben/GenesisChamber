## The Authenticity Test

After writing a soul document, test it:

1. Give the soul-loaded model a modern problem the real person never faced
2. Read the response WITHOUT seeing the persona name
3. Can you identify WHO this is from the response alone?
4. If yes → soul document works
5. If no → needs more behavioral and voice specificity

## Common Mistakes

1. **Wikipedia voice** — Soul reads like an encyclopedia entry, not a living personality
2. **All strengths, no weaknesses** — Missing blind spots and vulnerabilities
3. **Generic quotes** — Using famous quotes instead of revealing ones
4. **Missing speech patterns** — The persona sounds like everyone else
5. **No project calibration** — Responses are generic, not tailored to the brief
6. **Hagiography** — Treating the subject as perfect instead of complex
